    "## Broad reaching implications\n",
    "\n",
    "With some minor adjustments, our model can describe many physical phenomena. A short list of examples from various areas are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thermodynamics and Fluid Dynamics.** If two balloons are connected to a valve and inflated together in stages, but are able to exchange air through some patent connection, they will initially inflate together (provided the balloons are similar enough). If we inflate the balloons so they are stretched beyond their linear elastic regime, one of the balloons will empty into the other. This is an example of ***spontaneous symmetry breaking***. The system starts symmetric, with the left and right balloons inflating approximately in unison. Once we reach a threshold in pressure in the balloons, one of the balloons will take up all of the slack and the other will be empty. Since it is easy for us to track or measure, we could use the difference in the volume of the two balloons (i.e. $\\epsilon = \\left(V_{right}-V_{left}\\right)/V_{total}$ as a way to track this behavior. Looking at our energy equation, this means that $Q=\\epsilon$. With this choice, $K$ represents the stiffness or elasticity of the rubber in the balloon. The difference between the two volumes, $\\epsilon$ can be represented by a polar vector, connecting to our discussion of symmetry in one dimension. This is because the inversion operation and the 180-degree rotation switches the two balloons, but the other mirror leaves them unchanged.\n",
    "2. **Mechanics.** If we take a thin cylindrical beam oriented vertically between the floor and a piston we can see that it has rotational symmetry. If we engage the piston, the beam will be under pressure and eventually, after some threshold is reached, the beam will bow to the left, or right, or front, or back... Again, this problem can be mapped onto our spring-mass model, by taking $Q$ to be the deviation of the beam from midline, and $K$ as some description of the beam's elasticity. If we look at our initial configuration, we have all of the symmetries present (vertical mirror, horizontal mirror, 180-degree rotation) in our symmetry table. Once the beam bows, we lose the horizontal mirror and the 180-degree rotation symmetries. That means that this situation can be described by an axial vector.\n",
    "3. **Ferromagnetism.** Many materials, when cooled below a critical temperature become magnetic (called the *Curie temperature*). For example, iron (Fe), where we get the *ferro* prefix from, has a Curie temperature of between 1000 K and 1600 K. This behavior is due to the collective orientation of the electron spins in iron. In our simple model, $Q$ would represent the magnetization. When the temperature goes below the Curie temperature, the parameter $K$ becomes negative.\n",
    "4. **Superconductivity** Here $Q$ would need to be complex to represent the density and global quantum mechanical phase of the superconductor.\n",
    "5. **Higgs mechanism.** Here $Q$ describes the breaking of the electroweak symmetries.\n",
    "6. **Quantum Chromodynamics.** Chiral symmetry breaking in quarks.\n",
    "7. **Galaxy Formation.** In the early universe, matter is thought to have been uniformly distributed. Small deviations are thought to have led to galaxy formation where matter started to clump together. In this case, $Q$ would be the deviation of the density of matter from the average value.\n",
    "8. **Crystallization.** The transition from a liquid to a crystalline solid is very similar to galaxy formation.\n",
    "9. **Biology/Biophysics.** Many biological systems exhibit chirality/handedness at various scales. This preference for one handedness over another can be described by our model.\n",
