# Midterm Exam #1: Phase Transitions

In class, we motivated why a spring-mass system, or a harmonic oscillator, is so often the focus of study in physics. To name a few, it helps use to understand:

1. oscillatory motion;
2. stable orbits;
3. wave phenomena;
4. and, the behavior of systems near equilibrium.

In this midterm exam, you will explore a (nonlinear) oscillator model, in, very likely, a different way that you have in the past; when the spring-constant becomes negative. When this happens we will need to include higher order terms in opur description of the energy, otherwise the mass will accelerate off to infinity.

Let's start by defining the model.

## The basic model

We can use the following minimal model to describe our system.

$$ U = \frac{1}{2} K Q^2 + \frac{1}{4} D Q^4 $$

where $D>0$ and $K$ can be either positive, zero, or negative.

The model has broad implications in the study of physical phenomena. A short list of examples from various areas of physics are listed below:
